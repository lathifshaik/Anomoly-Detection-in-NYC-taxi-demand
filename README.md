# 🚕 TaxiWatch — NYC Taxi Demand Anomaly Detection

TaxiWatch is a data science project that looks at New York City taxi ride patterns and finds times when demand was unusually high or low. This kind of insight can help with planning, traffic management, or even pricing.

## 📊 What It Does

- Uses real ride data to look for strange patterns
- Finds times when demand suddenly spiked or dropped
- Helps understand traffic and city movement trends
- Shows results with easy-to-read graphs

## ⚙️ How It Works

This tool uses a machine learning technique called Isolation Forest, which is great for finding "anomalies" — data points that are different from the usual. The program loads taxi ride data, analyzes it, and shows where the weird patterns are.

## 🚀 How to Use It

1. Download or clone the code from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lathifshaik/Anomoly-Detection-in-NYC-taxi-demand).
2. Open the Python files in your code editor (e.g., VS Code or Jupyter).
3. Run the scripts to load data and see the anomaly detection results.
4. Graphs will show when and where the unusual taxi activity occurred.

> 📌 You’ll need Python and some common libraries like Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Finding odd spikes in taxi demand can help:
- City planners respond to unusual traffic
- Taxi companies adjust their fleet sizes
- Detect events or problems in real time
